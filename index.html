        <p> I am a second year graduate student at the <a href = "http://math.uga.edu"> University of Georgia </a>. On the right is a photo of me and my dad; I am the one on the left.</p>
Before coming to Georgia I was an undergraduate at <a href= "http://mth.uct.ac.za"> University of Cape Town </a> from where I also received my Master's degree.</p>
        <p>In between Cape Town and Athens, Georgia I spent a semester at the University of Bayreuth in Germany, working with <a href = "http://www.mathe8.uni-bayreuth.de/Personen/Catanese.html"> Professor Fabrizio Catanese </a> and his <i>Lehrstuhl</i>. </p>
        <p>You can find a copy of my C.V. <a href = "./Dan_mac_CV.pdf"> here </a>.</p>

        <h2> Research Interests. </h2>
        <p> I am working with my advisor <a href = "http://www.math.uga.edu/~rothstei/"> Mitchell Rothstein </a> on a higher dimensional analog of a construction, due to Krichever, which associates to an algebraic curve with a distinguished line bundle a solution to the KdV equation. Specifically, we are studying a way to associate to the data of a ruled surface over a hyperelliptic curve togehter with a degree zero line bundle a solution to the Schwarzian KdV equation.   </p>
        <p>I am also involved a VRG group led by <a href = "https://sites.google.com/site/angelagibney/"> Angela Gibney </a> investigating conformal blocks vector bundles on the moduli space of genus zero curves with n marked points.</p>

        <h2> Outreach. </h2>
        <p>While at the University of Cape Town I was involved with a really great organisation called <a href = "http://www.shawco.org/"> SHAWCO </a>.
        I worked on a project that offered after-school tuition to learners from three schools in the Kensington area of Cape Town. 
        We found the worksheets developed by the <a href = "http://academic.sun.ac.za/mathed/MALATI/Index.htm"> Malati Group </a> as well as
         the <a href = "http://www.theanswer.co.za/"> Answer Series Books</a> to be very useful. </p>

        <p>Here are some math related (well, most of them are math-related) links that I find useful:
