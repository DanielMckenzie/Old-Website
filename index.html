        <h2> About me. </h2>
        <img src = "./Dad_and_me.jpg" width = 25%> 
        <p> I am a third year graduate student at the <a href = "http://math.uga.edu"> University of Georgia </a>. On the right is a photo of me and my dad; I am the one on the left.</p>
	<p> On the 6th of June 2016 i passed my oral exam and was admitted to candidacy. You can find my slides in the 'notes' section of this page.</p>
	<p> Before coming to Georgia I was an undergraduate at <a href= "http://mth.uct.ac.za"> University of Cape Town </a> from where I also received my Master's degree.</p>
        <p>In between Cape Town and Athens, Georgia I spent a semester at the University of Bayreuth in Germany, working with <a href = "http://www.mathe8.uni-bayreuth.de/Personen/Catanese.html"> Professor Fabrizio Catanese </a> and his <i>Lehrstuhl</i>. </p>
        <p>You can find a copy of my professional resume  <a href = "./resume.pdf"> here </a>.</p>

        <h2> Research Interests. </h2>
        <p> I am primarily interested in applied and applicable math, and my advisor is <a href = "http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~mjlai/"> Dr. Ming-Jun Lai </a> </p>
        <p> I am currently working on an approach to spectral clustering for graphs that utilizes some ideas from Compressive Sensing. </p>
        <p>I have also thought about wavelets and multiscale dictionary learning lately. </p>
        <p> In a previous life I worked in pure mathematics, specifically algebraic and differential geometry.  </p>

        <h2> Teaching. </h2>
        <p> Here at UGA I have had the privilege of teaching Calculus and Pre-Calculus</p>
        <p> For the last two semesters I have been a TA for an experimental online Pre-Calculus course run through the University System of Georgia over several campuses </p>
        <p> This summer (2016) I am again the TA for online Pre-Calculus, and will be involved in adapting the course to the UGA summer schedule. </p>

        <h2> Outreach. </h2>
        <p>While at the University of Cape Town I was involved with a really great organisation called <a href = "http://www.shawco.org/"> SHAWCO </a>.
        I worked on a project that offered after-school tuition to learners from three schools in the Kensington area of Cape Town. 
        We found the worksheets developed by the <a href = "http://academic.sun.ac.za/mathed/MALATI/Index.htm"> Malati Group </a> as well as
         the <a href = "http://www.theanswer.co.za/"> Answer Series Books</a> to be very useful. </p>
