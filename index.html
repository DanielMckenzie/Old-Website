        <img src = "./Dad_and_me.jpg" width = 25%> 
	<p> I am an Assistant Adjunct Professor (ie. a postdoc) within the <a href = "http://www.math.ucla.edu/research/cam"> Computational and Applied Mathematics group at UCLA </a>. My primary advisor is <a href = "https://www.math.ucla.edu/~wotaoyin/"> Wotao Yin </a>. I received my PhD from the University of Georgia in May 2019. My advisor was <a href = "http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~mjlai/">Ming-Jun Lai </a>. Prior to that I was an undergraduate at <a href= "http://mth.uct.ac.za"> University of Cape Town </a> from where I also received my Master's degree. In between Cape Town and Athens, Georgia I spent a semester at the University of Bayreuth in Germany, working with <a href = "http://www.mathe8.uni-bayreuth.de/Personen/Catanese.html"> Professor Fabrizio Catanese </a> and his <i>Lehrstuhl</i>. You can find a copy of my CV  <a href = "./DanielMckenzieCV.pdf"> here </a>. On the right is a photo of me and my dad; I am the one on the left. </p>

        <h2> Research Interests. </h2>
        <p> I am interested in applied and computational mathematics. I enjoy using techniques from compressed sensing, graph theory and geometry to provide theoretically sound solutions to problems of practical interest in data science. Recently I have been thinking a lot about zeroth-order optimization. </p>

		    <li> <i> Zeroth Order Regularized Optimization (ZORO): Approximately Sparse Gradients and Adaptive Sampling. </i> Joint with HanQin Cai, Zhenliang Zhang and Wotao Yin. </li>
		    <ul>
			    <li> <b> Abstract: </b> We study the problem of estimating the gradient of a function using only function values and compressed sensing. Using the proposed gradient estimator, we provide a zeroth-order optimization algorithm that is more efficient than the prior state-of-the-art when the objective function has approximately sparse gradients. We show experimentally that many real-world functions do indeed have such gradients. </li>

		    <ul>
			    <li> <b> Abstract: </b> We link the problem of approximating the gradient of a function using only comparison based evaluations to one-bit compressed sensing.Similar to ZORO, we provide a gradient estimator and an optimization algorithm that exceeds the prior state-of-the-art when gradients are approximately sparse. </li>

		    	<ul>
				<li> <b> Abstract: </b> We explore further the use of power weighted shortest path distances for unsupervised learning on high dimensional data. We prove some nice results on fast computation of these distances. We examine more generally the interaction between data density and commonly used kernels in machine learning. </li>

				    <li> <b> Abstract: </b> We show how one can phrase the cut improvement problem for graphs as a sparse recovery problem, whence
one can use algorithms originally developed for use in compressive sensing. We use this new cut improvement approach as an algorithmic primitive to design new methods for local clustering and semi-supervised clustering. </li>

				    <li> <b> Abstract: </b> We study the use of power weighted shortest path distance functions for clustering high dimensional Euclidean data, under the assumption that the data is drawn from a collection of disjoint low dimensional manifolds. We argue, theoretically and experimentally, that this leads to higher clustering accuracy. We also present a fast algorithm for computing these distances </li>

	   <h3> Reference Letters </h3>
	   In general I am happy to write reference letters for undergraduates that I have taught or conducted research with. Before you ask me for a reference letter, here are some considerations:
	   <ul>
		   <li> It is hard to write letters for students that I do not know well. If our only interaction has been that I taught you, consider how much we interacted during this class and office hours. If our interactions were limited, perhaps I am not the best reference writer for you. <li>
		   <li> My policy is to write no more than 100 letters per year. You would be surprised how quickly this number is reached. So, if you would like a letter from me let me know early, and at least two weeks before any deadlines. </li>
		   <li> I can only write you a letter if you waive your right to read it. </li>
		   <li> Many application systems require my contact info and my job title. These can all be obtained from this web-page. </li>
		   <li> It is usually a good idea for us to meet briefly, either in person or via Zoom, to discuss the programs your are applying for and your motivation for graduate study. This really helps me write you a stronger letter. </li>
	   </ul>
	   <h3> For South African Undergraduates </h3>
	   If you are a South African undergraduate considering doing a PhD in mathematics in the United States, here is some general advice:
	    <ul>
		    <li> Apply early. </li>
		    <li> Consider applying to a few less prestigious or lesser known schools. Stanford and Harvard can only accept so many candidates a year, but there are many great schools, particularly in the Midwest and South-East, that are less oversubscribed. </li>
		    <li> Look into doing a semester abroad, an <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/mathreu"> REU </a>, or some other research exchange. Not only will you have fun and learn a lot, you'll make contacts that will be useful when applying for graduate school. </li>
		    <li> Consider applying for a <a href = "https://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries/selectedcountry/south-africa"> Fulbright Scholarship </a> </li>
		    <li> Have a website or blog on which you can share some of your mathematical projects or presentations. Admissions committees actually do look at these sorts of things. </li>
		    <li> If you have further questions, feel free to email me. </li>
