        <h2> About me. </h2>
        <img src = "./Dad_and_me.jpg" width = 25%> 
        <p> I am a rising fifth year graduate student at the <a href = "http://math.uga.edu"> University of Georgia </a>. On the right is a photo of me and my dad; I am the one on the left.</p>
	<p> On the 6th of June 2016 I passed my oral exam and was admitted to candidacy.</p>
	<p> Before coming to Georgia I was an undergraduate at <a href= "http://mth.uct.ac.za"> University of Cape Town </a> from where I also received my Master's degree.</p>
        <p>In between Cape Town and Athens, Georgia I spent a semester at the University of Bayreuth in Germany, working with <a href = "http://www.mathe8.uni-bayreuth.de/Personen/Catanese.html"> Professor Fabrizio Catanese </a> and his <i>Lehrstuhl</i>. </p>
        <p>You can find a copy of my professional resume  <a href = "./Resume.pdf"> here </a>.</p>

        <h2> Research Interests. </h2>
        <p> I am primarily interested in applied and computational mathematics, and my advisor is <a href = "http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~mjlai/"> Dr. Ming-Jun Lai </a> </p>
        <p> Currently, we are wrapping up a project that involves applying compressed sensing to clustering problems in Data Science.
		More details to follow shortly! </p>
	<p> I also have a side interest in Mathematical Finance. In `Notes' you can find some presentations
		and reports that fall loosely in this category. </p>
        <p> In a previous life I worked in pure mathematics, specifically algebraic and differential geometry.  </p>

        <h2> Outreach. </h2>
        <p>While at the University of Cape Town I was involved with a really great organisation called <a href = "http://www.shawco.org/"> SHAWCO </a>.
        I worked on a project that offered after-school tuition to learners from three schools in the Kensington area of Cape Town. 
        We found the worksheets developed by the <a href = "http://academic.sun.ac.za/mathed/MALATI/Index.htm"> Malati Group </a> as well as
         the <a href = "http://www.theanswer.co.za/"> Answer Series Books</a> to be very useful. </p>
