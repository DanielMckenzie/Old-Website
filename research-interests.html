    <h2> Research Interests. </h2>
        <p>I am interested in both Differential and Algebraic Geometry, as well as their interactions with physics. I do not currently have a thesis advisor, but I hope to choose one by the end of the summer.</p>
        <p> Currently I am working on three projects:
            <li>
                <ul>Gaining a solid understanding of schemes by reading chapter two of Hartshorne's "Algebraic Geometry"</ul>   
                <ul>Trying to understand Krichever's work on algebro-geometric solutions to the KdV equation, as well as <a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0201066">a generalisation to algebraic surfaces </a> </ul>
                <ul>Wrapping up some loose ends in my <a href = "./main.pdf"> masters thesis </a     ></ul>
    
            </li>
        </p>

<h2> Notes </h2>
<p>Below are some notes that I have written up</p>
<li> <ul><a href = "./main.pdf">My Masters thesis </a> </ul></li>

<h2> Outreach </h2>
While at the University of Cape Town I was involved with a really great organisation called <a href = "http://www.shawco.org/"> SHAWCO </a>. I worked on a project that offered after-school tuition to learners from three schools in the Kensington area of Cape Town. We found the worksheets developed by the <a href = "http://academic.sun.ac.za/mathed/MALATI/Index.htm"> Malati Group </a> as well as the <a href = "http://www.theanswer.co.za/"> Answer Series Books</a> to be very useful.

<h2> Links </h2>
Here are some math related (well, most of them are math-related) links that I find useful
 <li>
    <ul><a href = "http://math.stackexchange.com/"> math.stackexchange </a> </ul>
    <ul> <a href = "http://www.geogebra.org/cms/en/"> Geogreba </a> </ul>
    <ul> <a href = "http://www.codecademy.com/"> Codecadamy </a> </ul>
    <ul> <a href = "http://8tracks.com"> 8tracks </a></ul>
